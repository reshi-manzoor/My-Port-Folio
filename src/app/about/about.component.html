        I started my career at IBM in January 2015 as a Technical Ops Engineer. In April 2016, I joined the ITSS Development Team at Kashmir University, Hazratbal J&K, where I have been working ever since. Currently, I am a Senior Full Stack Developer.

        Throughout my career, I have worked on numerous projects using technologies such as .NET, Windows Forms, ASPX Forms, ASP.NET MVC, T-SQL, and various versions of MS SQL Server. I have also implemented Crystal Reporting, written procedures, triggers, cursors, tuned queries, and created functions, views, joins, indexes, and subqueries.

        On the frontend, I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap to design UIs myself. I have also worked with Angular 16.0 and above for UI development. For version control and repositories, I use tools like GitHub and Git Control.
